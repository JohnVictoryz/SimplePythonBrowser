Why do you want me to download different files for windows 10 and higher and windows 7 and lower?
Answer:The file for windows 10 and higher it is being compiled in a newer version of python that doesnt work on windows 8 and lower. But the vista and higher versions are build on an older version of python that works on windows 8 and lower. Keep in Mind if you have a pc with windows 10 and higher it is reccomended to have the version that was compiled on a higher version of python cause it has many updates and bug fixes than the other versions.
